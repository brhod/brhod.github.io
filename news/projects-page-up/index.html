<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I’ve uploaded a sample platter of the projects I’ve worked on over the years, so please feel free to check them out on the <a href="https://brhod.github.io/projects/">projects page</a>! It was kind of fun to go back and look at my previous work; I think the most salient thing to me was the variety of things I’ve worked on. Anyways, I’ve tried to give brief, intuitive and understandable descriptions, so the explanations you find there will be at a fairly high level. Also, keep in mind that a few of these projects are in the distant (for me) past, so for that reason as well I know I’ve glossed over some details. The details aren’t lost, though! In each page, I’ve either provided the papers, presentations, reports or repositories I reference.</p> <hr> <p>Please don’t hesitate to ask me about the projects!</p> </body></html>
