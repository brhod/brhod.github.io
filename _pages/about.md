Hello, my name is Brandon Rhodes, and I'm a Principal Data Scientist at Elevance Health. I am an experienced machine learning / data scientist, where I've done the following since entering industry:
- been the primary engineer / architect on a couple of deep learning pipelines (one which has been deployed to production and the other which is currently in the process of being deployed to production)
- been the primary engineer / architect of two generative AI pipelines, one which is embedded within an application and has been deployed to production and is used daily by 100+ users and the other which is currently being deployed to production (... they are RAG- and tool-based applications ... I have no experience with MCP or agentic frameworks)
- been a lead statistical consultant (essentially on retainer) for various business / operational matters (consulted the business on the design of an experiment, created a statistical framework + tools [with optional asymptotic approximations] for the business to be able to understand the risk of pushing a model to production and make a decision on whether to do so)
- been a co-organizor a reading group and been a mentor to three interns and various other more junior members


By training, I'm a statistician and linguist. I hold a M.S. in statistics from the University of Chicago, and I was A.B.D. in a Ph.D. program in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Chicago. I have some personal project experience in speech (acoustically grounded word embeddings, forced alignment of Mandarin speech) and computer vision (ultrasound image tracings).


I very much love statistical analysis and machine learning, and always welcome any questions people have regarding data that they have. I informally help friends in academia with these kinds of things. As for statistical frameworks, I am comfortable with both frequentist and Bayesian methods.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
