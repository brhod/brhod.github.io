Hello, my name is Brandon Rhodes. I'm a Senior Data Scientist at Elevance Health. I am an experienced data scientist and ML engineer by practice, and I'm a statistician and linguist by training. I hold a M.S. in statistics from the University of Chicago, and I was A.B.D. in a Ph.D. program in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Chicago. A lot of my industry experience has been in NLP and tabular data (healthcare), though I have some personal project experience in speech (acoustically grounded word embeddings) and computer vision (ultrasound image tracings).

From my current position, I have experience fine-tuning pretrained models (think: transformer architecture on the scale of 300M - 10B parameters) in a somewhat limited resource environment (think: one to two small GPUs) as well as engineering, training, and putting into production small feed forward neural networks. On the non-deep-learning front, I've also trained gradient boosted tree models, and I've implemented hiearchical generalized linear models (within a Bayesian framework). Most recently, though, I've worked a lot with foundational LLMs, building pipelines around them (think: RAG and agentic workflows).

I still have a research spark within me, especially with regard to multimodal deep learning and areas where machine learning and statistics intersect. With regard to the latter, two lines of work which I would love to get an opportunity to explore more are conformal prediction and confident learning.

I very much love statistical analysis, and always welcome any questions people have regarding data that they have. At my current company, I've served as a statistical consultant to help plan experiments and have developed methods (along with asymptotic approximations) to assess model performance. I informally help friends in academia with this kind of thing. Recently, I have developed a deeper interest in Bayesian methods.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
